# The road ends here for me this year.
# Hints for future me: Notice the relationship between the octal representation of reg_a and the output.
#                     Also remember that dividing a number by 2 is the same as right-shifting its bit representation.
#                     Somehow it should be possible to construct the output one digit at a time, using a DFS approach.
